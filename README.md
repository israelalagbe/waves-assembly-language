# Waves Assembly Language

Waves Assembly Language is a web-based compiler for a unique assembly language designed and implemented from scratch. Created as a part of my final year project in college in 2017, this project showcases a blend of creativity, technical skills, and innovation.

## Overview

The compiler interprets a custom assembly language, referred to as "Waves," and translates it into executable code. It is written in JavaScript and uses various libraries, including Jison parser, Metro UI, and Ace Editor, to offer an optimal user experience.

### Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Integrated with Ace Editor, providing real-time syntax highlighting.
- **Custom Parsing**: Utilizing Jison parser to interpret the unique syntax of Waves.
- **Modern UI**: Styled with Metro UI to offer an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface.
- **Interactive Experience**: Compile and execute code directly from the browser.
